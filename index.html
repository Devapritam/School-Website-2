                <h4>New Education POlicy 2020</h4>
                <img src="nep2020.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. One of the primary and major points of criticism is that our system tries to suit the scholars into three categories after class 10 are Science, Commerce, and humanities. Students are allowed to select only one stream and if they select any stream, then they can't study the topic of the opposite streams. And this is often very problematic because many students may have an interest in more than one subject. For instance - If any student has chosen science stream but his interest also lay in economics and politics, then he was not allowed to study economics and politics. But now, the government has changed this. Now, scholars can choose subjects with their own flexibility. After the execution of this policy, a student can study history with chemistry, and physics with politics. A student can study science, commerce also as art subjects. this is often a tremendous initiative. Now the scholars would have such a lot of flexibility to settle on.<br>2. The second major change proposed in the NEP is to replace the tutorial 10+2 academic structure with the 5+3+3+4 structure. Now it's become more almost like the education system of the western developed countries. In the 10+2 education system learning began at the age of 6. But in this new education system learning will begin at the age of three. Preschool would be from the age of three to six then 1 and a couple of subsequent 2 yrs. Then would be the preparatory stage for the subsequent two years during which focus would be upon playing activities based classroom structure.<br>3. Class 6 to eight would be the center stage during which the experimental learning would be the main target science, mathematics, science art humanities. Next would be the second stage of sophistication 9 to 12 during which multidisciplinary studies would be focused. Students would be given more flexibility and more choices. Vocational education will be given tons of importance like it is given in developed countries. The roles like welding, electrician, plumber, carpentry are viewed at an equivalent level because of the test of skilled jobs. In India, these jobs are checked out with disdain, which may be a mindset that must change. The government has implemented some structural change to vary this mindset, which is praiseworthy.<br>
                This is a really critical thing without which, we will not become a developed country until and unless these changes are implemented. Fortunately, the step taken by the government is in the right direction regarding this. Coding would be taught to the youngsters from class 6 and therefore the importance accorded to the board exam in school 10 and 12 would be reduced.<br>4. Another vital amendment that the committee has proposed in the existing draft of Education Policy is that it has finally set at least 6% investment of India's GDP will be spent on education. Presently it's around 4.3%, which is insufficient. And compared to other developing countries and remaining developed countries, India spends terribly less on education in the life of value. Investing 6% of GDP is a big task for India, especially considering the present economic situation. However, the impact of it can only be reviewed after the implementation of policy, for now, let's wait and watch.<br>5. Till now, there is a drag of rote learning within the Indian education system. Most of the exams are unit designed and are organized in such a method that requires mugging up of concepts in order to clear those exams. We all have been through that phase. The knowledge acquired by simply mugging up things evaporates in a few months as a result of which we fail to recall the actual concepts. Understanding the fact that merely clearing exams is not the objective of education. NEP has proposed to redesign the exam pattern in such a way through which actual and true knowledge of a student could be tested. But how exactly this will be achieved is not clearly mentioned in the NEP draft.</p>
